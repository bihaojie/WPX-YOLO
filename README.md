# WPX-YOLO

A wood-boring pest detection model based on X-ray images and YOLO

Our algorithm is an improvement based on the YOLOv8s framework. It can be reproduced by downloading the Ultralytics YOLOv8 version 8.2.50 and substituting our network architecture and modules within the existing framework.

We provide the following resources for the algorithm's reproduction: the optimal model file (WPX-YOLO.pt), the model architecture file (WPX-YOLO.yaml), training and validation datasets, and detection result images.

Erratum: In the paper titled "Non-destructive estimation of wood-boring pest density in living trees using X-ray imaging and Edge Computing techniques," an evident detail error was identified in Fig. 12. The authors have made the necessary corrections, and this error does not affect the overall content or findings of the paper.
